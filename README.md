# Noire

Noire is a minimalistic blogging website implemented entirely in
Nim and CSS.

It's features include:

- Author posts in plain markdown
- Elegant CSS styling, no clutter
- No javascript, easily accesible on all platforms across all browsers
- Server-side syntax highlighting for code blocks

## Why?

I originally designed it for my own blog, as i was dissatisfied with the current state of modern
web and particulary blogging solutions. They are either bloated or ugly, or both(imho, of course). So I decided
to take matters into my hands an develop a minimal blogging site that would stay out of the way
for both writer and reader, and being able to run on every possible potato one can find both server and clientside.

Thus, the design principles:

- Keep it stupid simple
- No clientside javascript (there is literally no need to script text documents)
